Week 2 Day 4;

If I wasn't frustrated before I certainly am now. We worked on our DiceGame this morning and made some progress but it wasn;t enough to complete. The issue pertained to arrays, looping through arrays, and then saving the players totals. It doesn't look like we were the only ones having the issue so misery loves company. I did get something out of Adam's coding but there it appeared that there wasn;t anythng already designed so we had a lot of testing, erors, more testing, etc. I look forward to reviewing the dice solution on Slash. With project work its tough for me to go home and study - spending all my time on trying to do the project and no time for understanding what I'm doing where. I look forward to weekends where I can catch up. Example is Arrays; we had a brief slideshow on arrays and then were given a project that included the use of arrays - no time to digest. I appreciate the instructors stopping during their presentations to answer questions, buut unless I have my hands on it I have issues relating what they're saying to what I see when I actually sit down to code. My biggest fear is that I'm learning to cut and paste code to make my projects work in order to meet the deadlines being given - that's not going to help when we're testing and I need to write code from scratch. I'm wondering whether DevCodeCamp is really the teachiing method that matches with the way I learn. We're on Day 9 now and all I can say is that I have a better appreciation of the language but not necessarily the way to implement/construct.
