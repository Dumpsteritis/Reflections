Week 2 Day 5;

Continued working on NIM and Happy Numbers. Had Dice Game review and it was an embarrassment. At the end I was given an assessment test to take which I totally froze on. Some of the simlest things were beyind my grasp even though I knew them - juts couldn;t organize my thoughts and put it on paper. Never was good at spot tests though. I appreciated Mike's basic tutorial thereafter and upon return started working through some of his problems. This time I'm refusing to cut and paste anything. I'll spend the whole weekend doing it but I better have this down as second nature.
